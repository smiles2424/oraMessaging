This is my entry for the Ora coding challenge. It was fun to learn all the new features of the
modern Spring stack with gradle. This project is using a number of Spring boot tools
to speed things up a bit. There are still a bunch of improvements to be made, but this is well 
on its way to becoming a full Chat API.

To run the application locally, you will need to have gradle installed and 
nothing running on port 8080.

0) Install gradle https://gradle.org/install
1) Run `gradle clean build`
2) Run `gradle bootRun`
3) localhost:8080 will be listening for requests
