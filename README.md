This is my entry for the Ora coding challenge. It was fun to learn all the new features of the
modern Spring stack with gradle. This project is using a number of Spring boot tools
to speed up development. I took the opprotunity to learn a new workflow, using VS Code with gradle
and CLI tools instead of relying on a full IDE. The last time I worked with Spring was a few years
ago on a Spring 2.5 app so I decided to embrace the newer way of working and learn as much as I could
about the framework. (a few things have changed since then)

This was developed on a Windows 10 machine

To run the application locally, you will need to have gradle installed and 
nothing running on port 8080.

1. Install gradle https://gradle.org/install
2. `git clone https://github.com/smiles2424/oraMessaging.git`
3. Run `gradle bootRun`
4. localhost:8080 will be listening for requests

You're good to go!

Thank you for the opprotunity
